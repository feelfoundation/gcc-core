## Alpha phase

Please read this carefully. With this repository we have opened access to the alpha release of the Feel SDK. We have released the Feel SDK in its current form in order for us to improve the development experience through community feedback and contributions.

We strictly discourage anyone from using the alpha release of the Feel SDK for any production-based blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a real mainnet. Over the course of the alpha phase there will be significant changes in the Feel protocol and implementation, which will eventually bring the accessibility and reliability to a level which is feasible for production-based blockchain applications. At this time we only recommend the Feel SDK for proof-of-concept blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a fake testnet.

The only application built using the Feel SDK currently feasible for production usage is [Feel Core](https://github.com/feelhq/feel-core), the client of the Feel network itself.

Please be advised we cannot guarantee blockchains created with the alpha release of the Feel SDK will remain compatible with our planned (beta/rc) releases.

We hope you enjoy building your proof-of-concept blockchain applications using the Feel SDK, and shall look forward to receiving your feedback and contributions during the alpha phase.

## What is the Feel SDK?

The Feel SDK aims to provide an easy and reliable software development kit for building blockchain applications which are compatible with the [Feel Protocol](https://feel.surf/documentation/feel-protocol). The architecture of the Feel SDK has been designed so that it can be extended to meet the requirements of a wide variety of blockchain application use-cases. The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript, which means for a majority of developers, no significant change of tools or mindset is required to get started. The Feel SDK makes every effort to allow developers to focus simply and purely on writing the code that matters to their own blockchain application, and nothing more.

## Usage

#### Dependencies

Before running Feel SDK, the following dependencies need to be installed in order to run applications created with the Feel SDK:

| Dependencies     | Version |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| NodeJS           | 10.4+   |
| PostgreSQL       | 10+     |
| Redis (optional) | 5+      |

You can find further details on installing these dependencies in our [pre-installation setup guide](https://feel.surf/documentation/feel-core/setup/source#pre-install).

Mind, that you need to create a database before. The default database name is `feel_dev`, so for the development purposes, a command `createdb feel_dev` will set you up.

### Installation

The installation of Feel Alpha SDK is straightforward and limited to getting a single NPM package, `feel-sdk`, to your Node.js project:

```
npm install feel-sdk@alpha
```

Feel SDK is all-in-one package that provides you with tools to create, run and maintain blockchain applications in JavaScript.

### Set up new a blockchain application

To start, create the project structure of your blockchain application. There are no special requirements here, you can create the basic Node.js project folder structure with `npm init`.

To create a blockchain application, you need to provide an entry point of your application (like `index.js`) and set-up your network by using the modules of Feel SDK.

It is quite simple to have a working blockchain application, mirroring the configuration of the existing Feel network. This can be done by copying the following three lines of code to your `index.js`:

```js
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet } = require('feel-sdk');

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet);

app
	.run()
	.then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
	.catch(error => {
		console.error('Faced error in application', error);
		process.exit(1);
	});
```

After that you can start the application by:

```
node index.js
```

### Configure your blockchain parameters

You can also define your blockchain application parameters such as `BLOCK_TIME`, `EPOCH_TIME`, `MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_BLOCK` and more with an optional configurations object.

```js
const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, {
    app: {
        label: 'my-blockchain-application',
        genesisConfig: {
            EPOCH_TIME: new Date(Date.UTC2020, 9, 18, 10, 0, 0, 0)).toISOString(),
            BLOCK_TIME: 10,
            MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_BLOCK: 25,
        },
        ...
});
```

For a complete list of configuration options see the [feel-docs repo](https://github.com/feelfoundation/feel-docs/blob/development/feel-sdk/configuration.md).

### Register a custom transaction

You can [define your own transaction types](https://github.com/feelfoundation/feel-docs/blob/development/start/custom-transactions.md) with Feel-SDK. This is where the custom logic for your blockchain application lives.

Add your custom transaction type to your blockchain application by registering it to the application instance:

```js
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet } = require('feel-sdk');

const MyTransaction = require('./my_transaction');

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet);

app.registerTransaction(MyTransaction); // register the custom transaction

app
	.run()
	.then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
	.catch(error => {
		console.error('Faced error in application', error);
		process.exit(1);
	});
```

For information on creating your own custom transaction, see the [feel-docs repo](https://github.com/feelfoundation/feel-docs/blob/development/start/custom-transactions.md) or [follow the tutorials](https://github.com/feelfoundation/feel-docs/blob/development/start/tutorials/hello-world.md).

## Architecture Overview

The Feel SDK operates on the NodeJS runtime and consists primarily of an application framework (Feel Framework), a collection of libraries providing blockchain application functionalities (Feel Elements), and a powerful command-line tool (Feel Commander) allowing developers to manage a Feel node instance and interact with a Feel compatible network. The diagram below provides a high-level overview of the architecture:

## How to Contribute

To contribute to `feel-sdk`, `framework` or `elements`:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/feelfoundation/feel-sdk.git`

2. Install dependencies and build:
   1. `npm ci`
   2. `npm run bootstrap`
   3. `npm run build`

### Testing local changes to `feel-sdk/framework`

Before testing local changes to `feel-sdk/framework`, follow the above steps for installation/building of dependencies and then run:

1. `npx lerna link`

### Testing local changes to `feel-sdk/elements`

Before testing local changes to `feel-sdk/elements`, follow the above steps for installation/building of dependencies and then run:

1. `npx lerna link`

2. Once you have linked your local repo, everytime you make changes in `feel-sdk/elements` you must build packages before testing:

   a. To build all packages: `npm run build`

   b. To build specific package: `lerna run build --scope <package name>`
   Example: `lerna run build --scope @feelhq/feel-p2p`

   c. To build packages that have been modified in your branch: `lerna run build --since <branch name>`
   Example:`lerna run build --since development`

**Note:** In case you face any issues during the installation make sure you have the right version of `npm` and `node` and try to install from scratch by running,
`npm run clean:node_modules && rm -rf ./node_modules`.

### Testing your local `feel-sdk` in your application.

In order to link your local feel-sdk repository and test your application which uses `feel-sdk`, simply follow the steps above in your local `feel-sdk` repository and run `npm link feel-sdk` in the root of your application.
